PDomEdit 0.2 alpha

To build, zip up the data folder and all lua files into a .love file.

I reccomend for GUI users to use 7Zip on Windows. Save the file as "pdomedit.love". The extension is important.

People on Linux/Unix/Mac OS X probably know of better ways ;P

Then run with Love2D.

A better manual will be designed, but for now:

Controls once in a game:
Arrow Keys = Move and Browse
L -> Layer Toggle
M -> Map Number Selection. Follow instructions on screen. Changes are sudden. Press Escape to back out
Ctrl+S - > Back up map and Save
Ctrl+O -> open current map number
D -> Eraser
F -> Pencil Tool
H-> Hollow Out Level to border
B -> Open Tile or Object Browser
Ctrl+Q -> Quit Program (Doesn't save changes so be careful!)
Space -> In browser, selects the object or tile and puts it into the palette. For objects, this also places said object on the map
Escape -> In the browser and Map number selection, this backs out.

F1 -> Pulls up a help dialog similar to this readme.

R -> Toggles an albiet buggy run mode. Might disappear at any time!

Layers:
1 - Tiles
2 - Objects (and later, doors)
